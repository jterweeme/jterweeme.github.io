<dt>People have alot to say about Penny Juice!</dt>

    THE CHILDREN AT KID KOLLEGE LOVE THE TASTE OF PENNY JUICE AND DRINK IT WITHOUT
    ENCOURAGEMENT FROM OUR TEACHERS. I LIKE PENNY JUICE FOR THAT REASON AND BECAUSE
    IT IS 100% JUICE FROM CONCENTRATE REQUIRING NO REFRIGERATION PRIOR TO MIXING.
    THE HANDY MIX PITCHER TAKE THE GUESS WORK OUT OF PREPARATION.

    AS TH DIRECTOR OF A UNIVERSITY AFFILIATED, BUT PRIVATELY OWNED CHILD CARE
    FACILITY TOP QUALITY PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALSO BUDGET-FRIENDY ARE ESSENTAIL. I
    ESPECIALLY LIKE THE EASE OF ORDERING ON-LINE OR BY PHONE, KNOWING THAT THE
    JUICE WILL BY PROMPTLY DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO THE CENTER. NO MORE HAULING
    SHOPPING CARTS FULL OF FROZEN JUICE CONCENTRATE FORM THE GROCERY STORE!

    THANKS, PENNYJUICE FOR SAVING ME TIME AND MONEY!
