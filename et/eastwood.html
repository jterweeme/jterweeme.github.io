Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release 
of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
versions of Lorem Ipsum.
